strat1 = optimal blackjack strategy, per google
strat2 = always double down 11, even on dealer's ace
strat3 = hit on 17 if dealer showing 8+
strat4 = always split 10's (google says never to do this, let's see)
strat5 = always split pair (probably dumb)
strat6 = akways doubledown pair (definitely dumb)
